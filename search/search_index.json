If you are opening the app for the first time then it may take some time for it to load all the dependencies required for the app! The app should look something like this when it loads Adding Custom Configurations \u00b6 You can easily change the behaviour of the termux application by defining properties for it in a key=value style method. For doing that, you first need to create a directory 1 named .termux Example $ mkdir $HOME /.termux Did you know? On OS X machines, the files which start with . are hidden. These aren't shown when you type in ls . To show these files you have to use the -a flag Example The directory and files are just for an example The . represents the current working directory. The .. represents the parent directory ~/ represent the home directory. If you are ever lost, just type in cd ~/ and you will be at the home directory. You can also do cd $HOME/ for the same. After doing this, you need to create a file named termux.properties in ~/.termux directory. You can do this with the following command: Example $ touch termux.properties Writing the configurations \u00b6 You need a command line tool to write on files directory, if you don't have root access (assuming most of you don't). You can use nano , vim , emacs , etc. for this. For the sake of this guide, we will be using nano because of simplicity!

These are ESC , TAB , CTRL , ALT , - , DOWN and UP . But you can always edit these if you want to! Use of keys like ALT , CTRL , ESC is necessary for working with a CLI terminal. Termux touch keyboards do not include one. For that purpose Termux uses the Volume down button to emulate the CTRL key. For example, pressing VOLUME DOWN+L on a touch keyboard sends the same input as pressing Ctrl+L on a hardware keyboard. The result of using CTRL in combination with a key depends on which program is used, but for many command line tools the following shortcuts works: CTRL+A \u2192 Move cursor to the beginning of line CTRL+C \u2192 Abort (send SIGINT to) current process CTRL+D \u2192 Logout of a terminal session CTRL+E \u2192 Move cursor to the end of line CTRL+K \u2192 Delete from cursor to the end of line CTRL+L \u2192 Clear the terminal CTRL+Z \u2192 Suspend (send SIGTSTP to) current process CTRL+ALT+C \u2192 Open new session (only work in Hacker's Keyboard) The Volume up key also serves as a special key to produce certain input: VOLUME UP+E \u2192 Escape key VOLUME UP+T \u2192 Tab key VOLUME UP+1 \u2192 F1 (and Volume Up+2 \u2192 F2, etc) VOLUME UP+0 \u2192 F10 VOLUME UP+B \u2192 Alt+B, back a word when using readline VOLUME UP+F \u2192 Alt+F, forward a word when using readline VOLUME UP+X \u2192 Alt+X VOLUME UP+W \u2192 Up arrow key VOLUME UP+A \u2192 Left arrow key VOLUME UP+S \u2192 Down arrow key VOLUME UP+D \u2192 Right arrow key VOLUME UP+L \u2192 | (the pipe character) VOLUME UP+H \u2192 ~ (the tilde character) VOLUME UP+U \u2192 _ (underscore) VOLUME UP+P \u2192 Page Up VOLUME UP+N \u2192 Page Down VOLUME UP+. \u2192 Ctrl+ (SIGQUIT) VOLUME UP+V \u2192 Show the volume control VOLUME UP+Q \u2192 Show extra keys view VOLUME UP+K \u2192 Another variant to toggle extra keys view Adding extra keys \u00b6 Termux also has an extra keys view which allows you to extend your current keyboard. To enable the extra keys view you have to long tap on the keyboard button in the left drawer menu. (Swipe from left \u2192 right to open the drawer) Abstract You can also press VOLUME UP+Q or VOLUME UP+K . Note From Termux v0.66, Extra keys are enabled by default. You can remove these by long pressing on the keyboard again Open the termux.properties file: Example $ nano ~/.termux/termux.properties Directory .../home/.termux doesn't exist If you get the above error, then that means that the .termux directory doesn't exist. Try making it, before doing this, with mkdir $HOME /.termux/ Now we will start by adding two rows of some really useful keys(default keys until v0.66) extra-keys = [[ 'ESC' , '/' , '-' , 'HOME' , 'UP' , 'END' , 'PGUP' ] , [ 'TAB' , 'CTRL' , 'ALT' , 'LEFT' , 'DOWN' , 'RIGHT' , 'PGDN' ]] extra-keys is the key and the value is a list(array) of lists with the extra keys! The extra-keys definition itself can also be spread over multiple lines, if desired, by \"backslash-escaping\" the line feed at the end of each line, thus: extra-keys = [ \\ [ 'ESC' , '/' , '-' , 'HOME' , 'UP' , 'END' , 'PGUP' ] , \\ [ 'TAB' , 'CTRL' , 'ALT' , 'LEFT' , 'DOWN' , 'RIGHT' , 'PGDN' ] \\ ] Success It should look something like this: Each key \"entry\" can be either a string (such as '|' , '/' or '=' ) or one of the values listed below. These values are defined in ExtraKeysView.java, and the list of values (not including possible synonyms) is: CTRL (\"special key\") ALT (\"special key\") FN (\"special key\") ESC (\"special key\") TAB HOME END PGUP PGDN INS DEL BKSP UP LEFT RIGHT DOWN ENTER BACKSLASH QUOTE APOSTROPHE Bug Each of the four \"special keys\" listed above should only be listed at most ONCE in the extra-keys definition i.e. do NOT have more than one CTRL key. Having more than one instance of any \"special key\" will result in a bug whereby those keys do not function correctly. Saving the properties \u00b6 Now you must save the file. To do so, you need to: Hit CTRL+X (or VOLUME DOWN+X which is the same thing.) Press y on the keyboard to save changes Press ENTER to save the filename! Enabling the changes \u00b6 Termux won't directly load the save changes. You can use any of the following ways to enable these changes: Restart the application! (Easiest way) Run source ~/.termux/termux.properties to load the file (The linux way) Run termux-reload-settings (the offical way) All 3 of these work the same. If one doesn't for you, then use the other For the linux nerds You don't need to follow any of the above steps. We didn't put this in the beginning because spoon-feeding is against our policies. Sorry, lol Use this one command if you want it to happen: Example mkdir $HOME /.termux/ ; echo \"extra-keys = [['ESC','/','-','HOME','UP','END','PGUP'],['TAB','CTRL','ALT','LEFT','DOWN','RIGHT','PGDN']]\" >> $HOME /.termux/termux.properties ; termux-reload-properties ; Success The keyboard on the bottom should look something like this now!
